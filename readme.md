# A script for encoding messages in images. 
## Usage
./steg [-d | -v | -h] [-o outputfile] [-i inputfile] [msg] filename

## Notes
This is obiously not at all secure... if you want security, encrypt the data before
encoding it in the image. 
Currently, only uncompressed formats like PNG are supported.
